# Counter App with Dark Mode

This is a simple, interactive counter app that allows users to increase, decrease, and reset the counter, with features such as customizable step size, keyboard controls, sound effects, and a toggleable dark mode. The app offers a modern UI, responsive design, and smooth transitions between light and dark themes.

## Features

- **Increment/Decrement Counter**:
  - Use the **"+"** and **"-"** buttons to increment and decrement the counter.
  - You can also use the **ArrowUp** and **ArrowDown** keys on your keyboard for the same functionality.
  
- **Custom Step Size**:
  - Customize how much the counter increments or decrements by entering a value in the step input field.
  - Default step size is **1**.

- **Double Increment/Decrement**:
  - Hold the **Shift** key while pressing the **ArrowUp** or **ArrowDown** keys to double the step size for faster increments or decrements.

- **Reset Counter**:
  - Use the **Reset** button or press the **r** key to reset the counter back to zero.

- **Keyboard Shortcuts**:
  - **ArrowUp**: Increment the counter.
  - **ArrowDown**: Decrement the counter.
  - **Shift + ArrowUp/ArrowDown**: Double the step size for faster increments or decrements.
  - **r**: Reset the counter to zero.
  - **m**: Toggle sound on/off.
  - **d**: Toggle dark mode on/off.

- **Sound Effects**:
  - A click sound is played every time the counter is increased or decreased, adding to the interactive experience.
  - You can toggle sound effects on or off using the **Sound Toggle** button or the **m** key.
  
- **Button Disabling at Limits**:
  - The **"+"** and **"-"** buttons will automatically be disabled when the counter reaches its maximum or minimum limits to prevent overflows.
  
- **Warning Message**:
  - When the counter reaches the maximum or minimum defined limits, a warning message will be displayed to alert the user.

- **Dark Mode**:
  - Easily toggle between **Light Mode** and **Dark Mode** using the **Dark Mode** button or the **d** key.
  - The app will remember your dark mode preference using **localStorage**, so your choice is persistent even after you refresh the page.

- **Responsive Design**:
  - The app is fully responsive and works seamlessly on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.
